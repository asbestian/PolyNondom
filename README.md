About
------

PolyNondom is a small tool that helps to enumerate and visualise
different sets of points, in particular, different subsets of
non-dominate points. It is not supposed to compete with proper solvers
for multi-criteria integer optimisation but to help in developing and
testing the latter. PolyNondom can be used to create and enumerate
multi-criteria assignment and cube instances and to visualise subsets
in objective space. The current supported subsets are:

- non-dominated points
- dominated points
- polynon-dominated points
- mononon-dominated points

Documentation
-------------

The documentation for PolyNondom
is [online available ](https://asbestian.github.io/PolyNondom/).  It
can also be compiled offline in the `/doc` folder via `make html` (provided
that [sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/) is installed).
