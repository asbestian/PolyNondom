Introduction
============
   
PolyNondom_ is a tool that helps to enumerate and visualise
different sets of points, in particular, different subsets of
non-dominated points. It is not supposed to compete with proper solvers
for multi-criteria integer optimisation but to help in developing and
testing the latter. PolyNondom can be used to create and enumerate
multi-criteria assignment and cube instances and to visualise subsets
in objective space. The current supported subsets are:

- :ref:`non-dominated <nd-label>` points
- :ref:`dominated <dom-label>` points
- :ref:`polynon-dominated <polynd-label>` points
- :ref:`mononon-dominated <monond-label>` points
